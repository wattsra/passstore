# Robbie's Simple Password Manager

Simple tool which stores salted and hashed passwords in a database
with a seperate name lookup database.

Not intended for actual use, just a proof of concept to exhibit the
different tools working together.

In active, solo development to further develop my skills.

## Usage:
Run:
```
git clone https://github.com/wattsra/passstore.git

cd passstore

python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 app.py
```
